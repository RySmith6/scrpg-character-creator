Welcome to the SCRPG open-source Character Creator!

This was originally a project for me to learn React, so there's a host of inefficiencies and sub-optimal code.

There are a few notable bugs, which will get logged as issues as people find them, and will get fixed as time allows.

TODO:
Archetype dice selection is wrong
exclusivity with previous steps when choosing stats
Divided and Modular Archetypes
Form-changer and Minion-maker auxilliary sheets

If anyone has some ideas about how/where to host, that'd be appreciated!
