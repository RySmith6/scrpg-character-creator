### Welcome to the SCRPG open-source Character Creator!

This was originally a project for me to learn React, so there's a host of inefficiencies and sub-optimal code. I'm going to start moving everything to functional components instead of class components, but here we are.

There are a few notable bugs, which will get logged as issues as people find them, and will get fixed as time allows.

TODO:  
- Retcon
- Finishing touches
- Font and sizing in PDF
- Divided and Modular Archetypes
- Form-changer and Minion-maker auxilliary sheets
